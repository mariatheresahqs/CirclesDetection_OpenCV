# Introduction

These days, many modern manufacturers have a necessity to track products and materials throughout their factories. Control of the process can be fundamental to the company's success because it can improve quality and efficiency by giving manufacturers real-time information into their operations. 
An important example of information is counting products at the end of the process, with the intention of avoiding losses. There are many ways to counting objects, such as sensors and computer vision. The last needs a camera, hardware, and a software that can read the information from an image and display it to the manufacturers in a friendly way.
# Objective

The objective of this test is to use computer vision to count the amount of loudspeakers produced in a factory. Assuming that both the quality of the image and the loudspeaker orientation cona change, face up or down, provide a flexible algorithm that can count how many loudspeakers are present on the image, regardless of the possibility of poor quality image.
Make sure your code is clean and understandable.
